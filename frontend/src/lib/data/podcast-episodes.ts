DUME returns as our voiceover! We're glad to have him back. Get your kiddie pools back out because a.) summer isn't quite over yet and you still haven't fulfilled your dream of filling the entire thing with mojito and drinking yourself into nirvana and b.) these hot takes will make you want to drink a kiddie pool full of mojito. Still not as bad as Twitter. Enjoy!`,
